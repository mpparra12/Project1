# Covid19 Data Analysis Project 1 

Module 7: Project 1 due date Wednesday August 2nd

Create a group of 3 or 4 people to find and analyze a dataset of our choice. In this case, we choose Covid 19 in USA dataset. Create a project in GitHub and share it with your classmates to be able to merge your work with them.  

Your group task for this project is to:

Come up with questions and create 6-8 visualizations of data(at least two per question)

Create a Power Point and have every visualization supported with a precise explanation.

Each question is responded and supported.

 
# Covid19 State-wide data analysis # 

Our team has begun the analysis of the statewide COVID-19 dataset and formulated the following questions to gain insights into the pandemic's impact across states:

1.	Are there any states that exhibit high positive, hospitalized, and death increases simultaneously?
2.	Is there a correlation between positive, hospitalized, and death increases across states?
3.	How have the trends in these variables changed over time?
4.	What are the weekly and monthly trends in positive, hospitalized, and death increases? What is the overall trajectory of the pandemic based on the weekly and monthly metrics?
5.	What are the typical ranges of total cases, death increases, and hospitalized increases for most states?
6.	Are there any geographic clusters of high or low increases in positive, hospitalized, and death cases?
7.What factors contributed to COVID-19 deaths in 2020?
### Key Steps to Answer Questions ###
- Created a new data frame with the formatted date. 
- Filtered the data with relevant variables, data cleaning & handle missing values.
- Calculated daily increases. 
- Plotted the total and average positive cases increase, deaths increase, & hospitalized increase. 
- Created a correlation matrix using positive cases, deaths, and hospitalized variables, and visualized in a heat map to understand the correlation between variables.
- Created maps using geopandas to show the intensity of cases, deaths, and hospitalized based on states. 
- Finally, calculated and plotted weekly and monthly positive cases, death, and hospitalized increases to see weekly and monthly COVID metrics.
